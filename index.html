            <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic individual who dreams in code and is not scared by bugs...
                I have the love for software engineering that has seen me be resilient in my journey,
                coming from a background in the social sciences and traversing to SWE. While it has 
                not been easy, I do believe that it has in a way prepared me to go further into the world
                of work and forge a career out of something am passionate about.
                While I currently have no experience in the world of work, I am actively in the search for gigs,
                I do believe they will prepare me the best. 
                I strive in teams as well as individually, and prefer vim over emacs ...

            <h2>IMAGINING THE FUTURE:</h2>
            <p>
                I see myself gravitating towards cybersecurity in the future, thing is I fell in love with code perchance in 2014!
                It was one good morning, a deadline day and as usual I was to print my assignments to hand them in later. And then <em>baam</em>, it struck!
                Instead of my assignment with Freudian philosophy, I found myself with an executable named Hot Fotos! I could have been mad...but no, within me welled fascination!
                I was in awe of such power and that's how I learnt batch scripting, writing hair-raising innocuous scripts. And that love has not died...it has brought me thus far and would like to make something huge of it. Perhaps a startup in cybersecurity someday...

            <p>
                I am a fast learner and keen individual who will require minimal supervision. I believe the best way of learning is by trying out things by myself and failing.
                I will bring with me my desire to learn and excellent communication skills...
